# Enhanced LaTeX to HTML conversion using `tex4ht`

This code was created for answer to [this question on TeX.sx](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/237566/2891). It shows how to use Mathjax for math rendering, Hypothes.is for annotating, and custom Javascript libraries for navigational sidebar and pop-up windows with bibliographic references.

You can see the result on my [Github
pages](http://michal-h21.github.io/reyman/thesis.html). Please note that this
is basically a proof of concept, so don't expect perfect design and
functionality.
